    <h1>Maddie's First Practice Site</h1>
    <p>My name is Maddie Burks.  I am a 28-year-old woman, and this is the first time I have made a foray into the world of coding since my Junior year of high school in 2006-2007.  I remember bits and pieces of HTML from the Webpage Design course I took that year.  That was also the year I got my first job at Publix.  Hard to believe that was over a decade ago now.  A lot has happened in that time, but here I am, and I am now my best self and eager to get back into this interesting field.</p>
    <h2>Jobs held over the years</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Publix cashier and customer service rep</li>
      <li>Staples Print and Copy Center Tech</li>
      <li>Pizza Hut Delivery Driver</li>
      <li>J. Christopher's Busser/Food Runner</li>
      <li>Buckhead Document Pros Team Member</li>
      <li>Service Specialist with DTI/Epiq Systems in the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>My goal in learning to code is to eventually become proficient enough at it to be able to build my own websites.  I have several ideas, including a site for my nature photography, a site listing resources and advice for transgender people in the state of Georgia (as well as a journal of my own experiences as a transgender woman), and also a weekly blog.  And, if I work hard enough and really dedicate myself, I hope to turn this venture into a profitable and rewarding career.</p>
