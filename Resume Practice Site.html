    <h2>A Special Section</h2>
      <section>As a transgender woman, I know all too well the problems discrimination of any kind can create in the workplace, both for the indiviual experiencing it and for coworkers who witness it.  Therefore, it is my aim to treat everyone fairly regardless of race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disablity, etc.  All people are equal in my eyes.  Our lives are all unique and individualized, and we all have our stories.  It is nobody's place to tell somebody that they are in any way inferior to another.  Judgement is not my job.
